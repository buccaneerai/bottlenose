## Description

Swashbuckler is a toolkit for wranging data and building data pipelines in isomorphic JavaScript.

Swashbuckler helps you write reactive, data-intensive applications that use expressive functional programming, behave predictably, run in most environments using pure isomorphic JavaScript (client, server and native), and are easy to test. It provides a great developer experience by keeping code simple and providing live, real-time calculations. The implementations are lightweight, performant, declarative and isomorphic.
