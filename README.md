## Description

üê¨ Bottlenose is a toolkit for analyzing data, building data pipelines and performing shallow machine learning in isomorphic JavaScript. Bottlenose builds useful analytics tools on top of the Observable pattern (using RxJS 6). This makes it easy to write applications that use expressive functional programming, behave predictably, run in most environments using pure isomorphic JavaScript (client, server and native), and are easy to test. It provides a great developer experience by keeping code simple and providing live, real-time calculations. The implementations are lightweight, performant, declarative and isomorphic.
