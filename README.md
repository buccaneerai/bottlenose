## Description
üê¨ Bottlenose is a set of data analysis and machine learning tools for software makers who love JavaScript. It uses [the Observable pattern](http://reactivex.io/documentation/observable.html) and [RxJS 6](https://rxjs.dev).

Bottlenose makes it easy to perform data analysis in native JavaScript, providing functionality modeled after gold standard tools like [R](https://www.r-project.org) and [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org).

It can also be used to build data-intensive applications that use reactive functional programming, behave predictably, run in most environments using pure isomorphic JavaScript (client, server and native) and are easy to test. It provides a great developer experience by keeping code simple and expressive. The implementations are lightweight, performant and declarative.
