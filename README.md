# Overview

üê¨ Bottlenose is a set of tools for performing data analysis and machine learning for software makers who love JavaScript. It uses [the Observable pattern](http://reactivex.io/documentation/observable.html) and [RxJS 6](https://rxjs.dev).

Bottlenose makes it easy to perform data analysis in native JavaScript, providing funcationality similar to [R](https://www.r-project.org) and [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org) in Python.

It can also be used to build data-intensive applications that use reactive functional programming, behave predictably, run in most environments using pure isomorphic JavaScript \(client, server and native\) and are easy to test. It provides a great developer experience by keeping code simple and expressive. The implementations are lightweight, performant and declarative.
